      <p>Some notes on things to remember for CSS3 that are a little different
        than what was originally covered in CSS.</p>
    <h2>Border Radius</h2>
    <p>This essentially is rounded corners on any element. This would include
      a solid border that encloses an element</p>
      <p>There should be some sort of text or image and not an empty box.</p>
    <div id="borderElement">
      <p>To get the border, in CSS select the element and type: `border-style:`
        and how you would like it. This is a `solid` border. To get rounded corners
        the element should be styled as `border-radius` and how much it should be.
        This is 15px. The higher the number, the more round it will be.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="border2">
      <p>This is the highest you can go.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Box Shadow</h2>
    <div id="border3">
    <p>This element has 4 parts: x-val, y-val, blur and black.</p>
    <p>This exact element looks like this: `box-shadow: 10px -2px 10px #000;`</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>The term 'Progressive Enhancement' refers to the use of newer features that
      add to the experience in modern browsers that support those features, but
      doesn't deract from the experience in older browsers.</p>
    <p>Essentially it means that if older browsers don't support it then some of
      the smaller details like box-shadow will not be seen, but it shouldn't
      detract from your overall layout.</p>
